        <p class="Body">You can use SQL Compliance Manager Reports to show that SQL Server compliance policies are being followed or that the procedures you have developed are having a positive impact on the way that SQL Server is being used in your environment. </p>
        <p class="Body">Once compliance has been established, SQL CM Reports allow you to track activity and identify problems so that they can be resolved and compliance can be maintained. In addition to being able to generate compliance reports on your SQL Server environment, you can also assign read-only access to SQL CM to designated users so they can generate the reports they need.</p>
