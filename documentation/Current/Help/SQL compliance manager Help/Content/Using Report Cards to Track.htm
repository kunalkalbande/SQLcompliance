        <p class="Body">SQL Compliance Manager includes several Activity Report Cards that display up to 30 days of SQL Server activity. Activity Report Cards allow you to view the SQL Server activity at the enterprise and individual SQL Server instance levels. These report cards allow you to quickly check activity in each event category audited, view SQL Server activity statistics, and short-term activity trends. Activity Report Cards can be used to identify problems that might require more in-depth analysis.</p>
        <p class="StepIntro">To view report cards:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">Select <span class="GUI_Item">Audited SQL Servers</span> from the <span class="GUI_Item">Explore Activity</span> tree to see the Enterprise Activity Report Card. The Enterprise Activity Report Card allows you to review the status of your audited SQL Servers and the recent activity that has occurred on them.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Select any SQL Server instance from the <span class="GUI_Item">Explore Activity</span> tree to see the Server Activity Report Card. The Server Activity Report Card allows you to review the activity status and recent audit event history on your SQL Server instance.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Select any database from the <span class="GUI_Item">Explore Activity</span> tree to see Recent Database Activity Summary. The Recent Database Activity Summary allows you to review the recent database activity and a listing of recent audit events that have occurred on the selected database.</li>
