        <p class="Body">The Audit Reports window contains a reporting interface that allows you to generate audit reports. Each report is based on a template file that is stored in the Reports folder in the SQLcompliance installation directory. When you generate a report, you are able to determine what is displayed by selecting from the options on each individual report. This allows you to generate reports tailored to your needs.</p>
        <p class="Body">In addition, report template files can be integrated into Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (Reporting Services) to allow you to further customize your reports when necessary. For more information, see <a href="Customizing Reports.htm" target="_self">Customizing Reports</a>.</p>
