        <p class="Body">SQL Compliance Manager allows you to use Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (Reporting Services) to provide on-the-spot reporting on your audit data. The Report Server computer should meet or exceed the hardware and software requirements recommended by Microsoft to run and manage the Reporting Services components. </p>
        <p class="Body">To successfully use Reporting Services in a SQL Server 2000 environment, deploy Reporting Services version 1.0 SP1 or later (SP2 recommended). For SQL Server 2005 or later environments, deploy the Reporting Services components released with the current version of SQL Server.</p>
        <p class="Body">To successfully integrate SQL CM reports with Microsoft Reporting Services, ensure your logon account has Content Manager Rights on the Report Server.</p>
