Use Event Filters to improve scalability and remove unwanted events from the audit data stream.&#160;</p>
        <p class="Body">Event Filters allow you to further customize your audit data collection. For example, you can configure Event Filters to accommodate the following auditing needs:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li class="Bullet">Exclude “noise” events and events generated from expected business activity, such as <span class="Code">INSERTS</span> and <span class="Code">DELETES</span> performed on a Sales database by a standard application</li>
            <li class="BulletLast">Provide more precise data about specific database activity, such as collecting DDL and DML events for one table but only collecting DDL events for another table</li>
        </ul>
