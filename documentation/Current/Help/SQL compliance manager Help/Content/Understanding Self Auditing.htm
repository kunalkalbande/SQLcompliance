            <MadCap:keyword term="auditing:SQLcompliance Agent;auditing:self-auditing" />Auditing your SQL&#160;Compliance&#160;Manager implementation is called self-auditing. Self-auditing consists of regularly checking the integrity of the Repository databases. You can also audit the Repository databases. For example, you can audit specific events, such as logins, on the Repository. For more information, see <a href="Registering Your SQL Servers.htm" target="_self">Registering your SQL Servers</a> and <a href="Verifying Audit Data Integrity.htm" target="_self">Verifying audit data integrity</a>.</p>
        <p class="Body">Tracking SQL&#160;CM activities is called monitoring. By default, the Collection Server gathers specific event data on the Repository databases. SQL&#160;CM automatically monitors change activity as well as SQLcompliance Agent events. SQL&#160;Compliance&#160;Manager lists these activities and events in the Activity and Change Logs. For more information, see <a href="Monitoring SQLcompliance Activities.htm" target="_self">Monitoring SQLcompliance Agent activities</a>.</p>
        <p class="Body">Using these built-in features, you can ensure your audit settings and data remain secure and uncompromised. You can also ensure your SQL&#160;CM implementation complies with your internal and external policies.</p>
