        <h1 class="Heading1">Change the Reporting Services data source</h1>
        <p class="Body"> Reporting Services leverages the Repository as the data source when generating reports. To use Reporting Services to report on your audit data, ensure the data source has been correctly configured, allowing Reporting Services to find and connect to the Repository.</p>
        <p class="Body"> For example, when you migrate the Collection Server to another computer, the Repository location changes accordingly, causing the data source configuration to become invalid.</p>
        <p class="Body">You can configure Reporting Services using  the Report Manager Web interface.</p>
