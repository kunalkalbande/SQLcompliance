        <p class="Body">Exported event filter settings are saved in an XML format and can be applied to other registered SQL Server instances. This flexibility saves you time when you are configuring Event Filters on multiple SQL Server instances, and helps ensure consistent Event Filters across your environment. In addition, exporting allows you to back up your Event Filters to use should you need to reinstate an audited SQL Server instance. As you configure your Event Filters, consider what you would like to save for future use, and export the filters for that particular SQL Server instance or database.</p>
        <p class="StepIntro">To export your Event Filters:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">Navigate to <span class="GUI_Item">Event Filters</span> in the <span class="GUI_Item">Administration </span>tree.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Click <span class="GUI_Item">Export Filters</span> on the<span class="GUI_Item"> Event Filters</span> ribbon.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Specify a file name or use the default name.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Select the location to save the output file. Consider saving all Event Filters to a centralized location such as a network share.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Click <span class="GUI_Item">Save</span>.</li>
        </ol>
