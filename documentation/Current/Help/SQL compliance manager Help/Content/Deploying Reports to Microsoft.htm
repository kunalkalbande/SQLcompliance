        <p class="Body">The Deploy Reports wizard allows you to integrate SQL Compliance Manager reports into Microsoft Report Services. Perform this deployment for each Repository that contains data you want to audit using Microsoft Reporting Services. The following procedure guides you through a remote install.</p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="If_Then_Statement">If the Repository databases are located in a non-trusted domain</span>, deploy the reports to the same physical computer that is hosting the Repository databases (by default, this computer is also the Collection Server). To ensure successful authentication, ensure the target computer is running a local install of Microsoft Reporting Services. </p>
        <p class="StepIntro">To install reports:</p>
