            <MadCap:keyword term="alerts:alert rule;alerts:how they work;alerting:alert rule;alerting:how Status Alerts work;Status Alerts:how they work" />SQL&#160;Compliance&#160;Manager can generate a Status Alert when it receives a status update from the Collection Server or SQLcompliance Agent that is unsafe and could disrupt your ability to audit your SQL Server instances. Alert rules define what type of status is considered unsafe and how  SQL&#160;CM should respond. You can configure SQL&#160;CM to write a custom alert message to the  application event log and send an alert email notification to your corporate and  personal SMTP accounts when the alert is triggered. For more information, see <a class="MCXref" href="Use Status Alerts.htm" mc_format="{para}">Use Status Alerts to ensure compliance</a>.</p>
        <p class="Body">There are two categories of Status Alerts: alerts that track the Collection Server status and alerts that track the SQLcompliance Agent status. In general, when the Collection Server or SQLcompliance Agent communicates at their heartbeat intervals, each service confirms its health and compares its status information against the alert rules you have defined. An alert message is generated when the status is deemed unsafe. By default, each heartbeat occurs in five-minute intervals.</p>
        <p class="Body">Depending on the amount of alert activity your environment generates, you may want to groom alert messages on a routine basis. For more information, see <a href="Grooming Alerts Concept.htm" target="_self">Grooming Alerts</a>.</p>
