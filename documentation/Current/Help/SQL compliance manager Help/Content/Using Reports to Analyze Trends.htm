        <p class="Body">You can use SQL Compliance Manager Reports to track activity trends over a period of time. This allows you, for example, to check peaks in activity to be sure that they are only occurring in expected periods of time. If you use Microsoft Reporting Services, you can automate the generation of daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly reports.</p>
        <p class="Body">Using SQL CM Reports to track trends over time also allows you to see potential problems that are occurring with a higher frequency over time, and might require your attention. This can be a useful way to reinforce SQL Server compliance policies and catch problems before they become a bigger issue.</p>
