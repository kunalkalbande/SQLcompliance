        <p class="Body">This window allows you to choose when and how you want to deploy the SQLcompliance Agent to the target SQL Server instance. You can deploy the SQLcompliance Agent now or later using the SQL&#160;Compliance Manager Management Console, or manually using the setup program.</p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="If_Then_Statement">If you are auditing a virtual SQL Server</span>, you must manually deploy the SQLcompliance Agent to each cluster node hosting the server. Use the Cluster Configuration Console to deploy and configure the SQLcompliance Agent. For more information about installing and configuring the SQLcompliance Agent for a virtual SQL Server, see <a href="../Audit Virtual Instance.htm" target="_self">How to audit a virtual&#160;SQL&#160;Server instance</a>.</p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="If_Then_Statement">If you are auditing a SQL Server instance hosted by a computer that belongs to a non-trusted domain or a workgroup</span>, you must manually deploy the SQLcompliance Agent to the host computer using the SQL compliance manager setup program.</p>
        <p class="Body">Choose the deployment option that is appropriate for your environment, and then click <span class="GUI_Item">Next</span>.</p>
