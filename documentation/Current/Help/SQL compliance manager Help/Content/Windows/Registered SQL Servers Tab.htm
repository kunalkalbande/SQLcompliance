        <h1 class="Heading1" MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">Registered SQL Servers Tab</h1>
        <h2 class="Heading2" MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">Registered SQL Servers Tab</h2>
        <p class="Body">This tab lists the SQL Server instances that are registered for SQL Compliance Manager to audit. This list includes the following types of registered servers:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li class="Bullet">SQL Server instances running in trusted domains</li>
            <li class="Bullet">SQL Server instances running in non-trusted domains or workgroups</li>
            <li class="BulletLast">Virtual SQL Servers hosted by Microsoft failover clusters (Microsoft Cluster Services)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">Registering a SQL Server instance allows you to audit events at the server and database levels. You can configure audit settings for each registered instance and hosted database.</p>
        <p class="Body">This tab lists the registered SQL Server instances you have audited. Auditing allows you to collect specific events from the SQL Server trace. This list contains SQL Servers you are currently auditing. <span class="If_Then_Statement">If you disabled auditing on a SQL Server instance</span>, this window continues to list the server until you remove the server. </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Available actions</h2>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Register New Server</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to register an additional SQL Server instance with SQL CM.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Register New Database</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to enable auditing and configure audit settings for a database on the selected SQL Server instance. To manage settings for a database you are currently auditing, use the Audited Database Properties window.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Enable Auditing</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to enable auditing on the selected SQL Server instance. When you enable auditing, the SQLcompliance Agent begins collecting events on the selected SQL Server instance, and sends the SQL trace files to the Collection Server.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Disable Auditing</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to disable auditing on the selected SQL Server instance. When you disable auditing, the SQLcompliance Agent stops collecting new event data, and stops the corresponding SQL trace. You can continue to view and report on previously audited events or archived events.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Server Settings for Audited Server Activities</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to view and modify audit settings for the selected SQL Server instance.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Server Settings for Privileged Users</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to view and modify which privileged users are audited on the selected SQL Server instance.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Database Settings for Audited Database Activities</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to view and modify audit settings for the selected database. This action is available when you select a database from the <span class="GUI_Item">Audited Databases</span> list.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Database Settings for Trusted Users</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to view and modify which users are considered trusted users on the selected database. Trusted users are not audited.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Import</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to import audit settings previously exported from another SQL Server instance or database.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Export</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to export audit settings configured for this SQL Server instance to an XML file. You can later use this file to import audit settings across multiple SQL Server instances or databases, ensuring consistent alerting on activity throughout your environment.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Update Now</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to send your audit setting changes to the SQLcompliance agent immediately. Typically, the Collection Server sends audit setting updates at each heartbeat communication from the SQLcompliance Agent. By default, a heartbeat occurs every five minutes. To view the SQLcompliance Agent heartbeat details, use the General tab on the SQLcompliance Agent Properties window.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Collect Audit Data Now</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to force the SQLcompliance Agent to send trace files to the Collection Server for processing. Typically, the SQLcompliance Agent sends trace files to the Collection Server at the specified collection interval. By default, a trace file collection occurs every two minutes.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Agent Properties</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to view and modify settings for the SQLcompliance Agent that is auditing the selected SQL Server instance.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Check Agent Status</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to check the status of the SQLcompliance Agent on the selected SQL Server instance, such as whether or not the agent is active.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Deploy Agent</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to deploy the SQLcompliance Agent to one or more registered SQL Server instances. Deploying the agent installs the SQLcompliance Agent Service on the target instance, and allows you to begin auditing events.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Upgrade Agent</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to upgrade the SQLcompliance Agent on the selected SQL Server instance to the current version. This option is available if the agent was remotely deployed through the Management Console. To upgrade an agent that was manually deployed, run setup.exe from the SQL compliance manager installation kit on the target SQL Server computer.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Change Agent Trace Directory</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to specify a different trace directory for the SQLcompliance Agent. The agent uses the specified folder to store trace files before sending these files to the Collection Server for processing.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Refresh</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to update the Registered SQL Servers list with current information.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Remove</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to unregister the selected SQL Server instance. When you remove a SQL Server instance, SQL Compliance Manager disables all auditing at the server and database levels on the SQL Server instance. <span class="If_Then_Statement">If the selected instance is the last instance to be audited on this SQL Server</span>, SQL CM also uninstalls the SQLcompliance Agent. <span class="If_Then_Statement">If you manually deployed the SQLcompliance Agent</span>, you must manually uninstall it from the SQL Server computer.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Available columns</h2>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">SQL Server</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Provides the name of the SQL Server instance, using the format SQLServerName\InstanceName.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Status</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Indicates whether SQL Compliance Manager detected an auditing or configuration issue. For example, if the selected SQL Server instance is unavailable, SQL CM displays an error.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody"><span class="If_Then_Statement">If a system alert has been triggered</span>, the <span class="GUI_Item">Status </span>column displays the alert type. System alerts notify you when the health of your SQL&#160;Compliance Manager deployment may be compromised. For more information, see the <a href="Activity Log Tab.htm" target="_self">Activity Log tab</a>.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Audit Status</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Indicates whether auditing is enabled on the selected SQL Server instance. When auditing is disabled, the SQL trace is stopped and the SQLcompliance Agent no longer collects events.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody"><span class="If_Then_Statement">If a system alert is triggered</span>, the Audit Status column instruct you to view the Activity Log to determine which event triggered this alert.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Last Agent Contact</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Provides the date and time when the SQLcompliance Agent last received audit setting updates from the Collection Server (also called a heartbeat). To view the SQLcompliance Agent heartbeat details, use the General tab on the SQLcompliance Agent Properties window.</p>
