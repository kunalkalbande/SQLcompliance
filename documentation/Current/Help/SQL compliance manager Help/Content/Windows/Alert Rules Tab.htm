        <h2 class="Heading2" MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">Alert Rules tab</h2>
        <p class="Body">This SQL Compliance Manager tab allows you to create new alert rules and manage existing alert rules. An alert rule is a set of criteria that determines when an alert should be generated as the Collection Server processes SQL Server events collected from your audited instances. Use alert rules to detect events that occur on specific databases, users, or instances.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Available actions</h2>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">View alert rule description</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Use the<span class="GUI_Item"> Rule Description </span>pane to quickly see which parameters are configured as criteria for this alert.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Set alert criteria</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Use the links in the <span class="GUI_Item">Rule Description</span> pane to change the value or setting of a specific rule criterion.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">New Event Alert Rule</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to create a new alert using the New Event Alert Rule wizard. SQL CM stores this alert rule in the Repository.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">New Status Alert Rule</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to create a new alert using the New Status Alert Rule wizard. SQL CM stores this alert rule in the Repository.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">New Data Alert Rule</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to create a new alert using the New Data Alert Rule wizard. SQL CM stores this alert rule in the Repository.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Create new alert rule from an existing rule</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to create a new alert using the selected rule as a template. This action launches the New Alert Rule wizard, each window populated with alert criteria from the selected rule. You can change any alert criterion to meet the goals of your new alert rule. SQL CM stores the new alert rule in the Repository. The selected rule remains unchanged.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Enable Alert Rule</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to enable the selected rule. When an alert rule is enabled, SQL CM processes audited events using the selected criteria in this rule. <span class="If_Then_Statement">If an event matches the alert criteria and an alert action is configured</span>, SQL CM writes an alert message to the application event log or email it to the specified addresses. Alert messages are also available using the Alerts tab.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Disable Alert Rule</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to temporarily stop using the selected rule. SQL CM no longer uses this alert rule when processing events. All alert messages previously generated by this rule will remain available through the Management Console and the application event log, if event log notification was configured. To reinstate this alert, enable the alert rule.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Import Rules</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to import alert rules previously exported from another SQL Server instance. By default, the imported alert rules are disabled.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Export Rules</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to export all previously-created alert rules to an XML file. You can later use this file to import alert rules across multiple SQL Server instances, ensuring consistent alerting on activity throughout your environment.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">View Details</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to view or change the alert criteria for the selected rule.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Delete</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to permanently delete the selected rule. Deleting an alert rule removes the rule from the Repository. SQL CM no longer uses this alert rule when processing events. All alert messages previously generated by this rule will remain available through the Management Console and the application event log, if event log notification was configured. <span class="If_Then_Statement">If you want to temporarily stop using an alert rule</span>, disable the alert rule.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Refresh</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to update the Alert Rules list with current data.</p>

        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Level</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Provides the alert level, such as High. Depending on the rule type, you can change the alert level using either the Edit Event Alert Rule or Edit Status Alert Rule wizard. </p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Email</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Indicates whether the alert rule criteria includes email notification.
