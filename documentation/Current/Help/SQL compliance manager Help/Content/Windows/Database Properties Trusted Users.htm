        <p class="Body">Trusted users are SQL Server logins and members of SQL Server roles that you trust to read, update, or manage a particular audited database. The SQLcompliance Agent removes events generated by trusted users from the audit trail before sending the trace file to the Collection Server for processing. This exclusion occurs for all auditing, including DML&#160;and SELECT&#160;events related to sensitive columns and before and after data.</p>
        <p class="Body">By designating trusted users, you can more efficiently audit databases used by third-party applications, such as SAP, that are self-auditing. Self-auditing applications are able to audit activity and transactions initiated by their service accounts. Because service accounts can generate a significant number of login and database change events, omitting these expected events from your audit data trail lets you more easily identify unexpected activity.</p>
        <p class="Body">When you designate trusted users, consider limiting your list to a few specific logins. This approach optimizes event processing performance and ensures you filter the intended accounts.</p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="If_Then_Statement"> If you are auditing privileged user activity and the trusted user is also a privileged user</span>, SQL Compliance Manager will continue to audit this user because of its elevated privileges. For example, a service account that is a member of the <code class="Code_1_1">sysadmin</code> fixed SQL Server role will continue to be audited even though the account is designated as trusted. Keep in mind that trusted users are filtered at the database level whereas privileged users are audited at the server level.</p>
        <p class="Body">To omit, or filter, events generated by specific logins and roles from your audit data trail, click <span class="GUI_Item">Add</span>, and then select the SQL Server login or role you want to trust.</p>

                        <p class="TableText">When you want to specify multiple accounts as trusted users, consider creating a Windows group that contains only those users. This approach allows you to better manage your trusted users and ensures you do not accidentally trust additional accounts due to unexpected group membership (such as  through nested groups). Creating a unique group for trusted users prevents unintended omissions in your audit data.</p>
