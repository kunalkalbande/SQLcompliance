        <p class="Body">This tab allows you to change which types of SQL Server events you want to audit on the selected databases. Use the <a href="Audit Events Tab.htm" target="_self">Audited Events tab</a> to see your collected data.</p>

        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Audited Activities</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you select the type of activity you want to audit. Based on your selections, SQL Compliance Manager collects and processes the corresponding SQL Server events.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Access Check Filter</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to refine your audit trail for SQL Server login data by collecting events that better reflect your auditing requirements for security and user processes. </p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">SQL Server validates login permissions and access rights when a user attempts to execute an operation or SQL statement on the audited SQL Server instance. <span class="If_Then_Statement">If the access check filter is enabled for a database on a registered instance</span>, SQL CM collects access check events at the database level. </p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBodyLast">Select this filter to help identify logins that may have inappropriate access rights or permissions. This filter may also help reduce the size of your audit data.</p>

This setting captures begin, commit, rollback, and savepoint statuses. To capture these statuses, you must enable DML auditing.</p>
