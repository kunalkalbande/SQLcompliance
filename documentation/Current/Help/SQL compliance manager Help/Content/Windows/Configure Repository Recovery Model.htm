        <p class="Body">This tab allows you to select which database recovery model you want the Collection Server to configure when creating databases to store audit data in the Repository. You can choose either the simple model or the default model. The Collection Server applies this setting to new event databases created for each audited SQL Server instance and new archive databases.</p>
        <p class="Body">A database recovery model controls whether transaction logs are backed up for each database. The simple model does not allow you to back up transaction logs for a database. The default model does allow you to back up transaction logs for a database. The default model is the recovery model configured for the model database. Typically, when a database is created, SQL Server applies the model database properties to the new database. The model database properties on the SQL Server that hosts the Repository should reflect your overall backup and disaster recovery strategies. Before choosing the default recovery model setting, verify that the model database properties are correct.</p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="If_Then_Statement">If you are auditing SQL Servers in a trial environment or have not implemented a backup strategy for the Repository databases</span>, select the simple recovery model.</p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="If_Then_Statement">If you are auditing production SQL Servers and have implemented a backup strategy for the Repository databases</span>, select the default recovery model.</p>
        <p class="Body">Select the appropriate database recovery model, and then click <span class="GUI_Item">OK</span>. </p>
        <p class="Body">You can change your selection at any time. When you select a different database recovery model, your change affects new databases only. Ensure you manually change the database recovery model used on each existing Repository database.</p>
