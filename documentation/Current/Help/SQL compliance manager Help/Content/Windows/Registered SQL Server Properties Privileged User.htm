        <p class="Body">This tab allows you to change the audit settings currently applied to privileged users on this SQL Server instance. You can choose to audit event categories and user defined events. An event category includes related SQL Server events that occur at the server level. A user defined event is a custom event you create and track using the<code> sp_trace_generateevent</code> stored procedure.</p>
        <p class="Body">For example, you can audit individual SQL Server logins with privileged access, logins that belong to specific fixed server roles, all activities, or specific activities.</p>
        <p class="Body">When you update audit settings to audit privileged user activities, these changes are not applied until the SQL trace is refreshed. The SQL trace is refreshed when the SQLcompliance Agent sends the trace files to the Collection Server. To ensure an immediate application of your new audit settings, click<span class="GUI_Item"> Update Audit Settings Now</span> on the Agent menu.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Available actions</h2>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Add</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to select one or more privileged users to audit. You can select privileged users by login name or by membership to a fixed server role.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Remove</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to remove the selected SQL Server login or fixed server role from the list of audited privileged users. When you remove the login or role, the SQLcompliance Agent no longer collects events recorded for that login or the role members.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Available fields</h2>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Privileged users and roles to be audited</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Lists the audited privileged users by login name or fixed server role. <span class="If_Then_Statement">If you are auditing privileged users in a fixed server role</span>, the SQLcompliance Agent collects activities executed by all members of the selected role. </p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Audited Activity</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to specify which activities (events) you want to audit for the selected privileged users.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Capture SQL statements for DML and SELECT activities</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to specify whether you want to collect SQL statements associated with audited DML and SELECT activities. To capture these statements, you must also enable DML or SELECT&#160;auditing.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Ensure the Collection Server and the target SQL Server computers have ample resources to handle the additional data collection, storage, and processing. Because this setting can significantly increase resource requirements and negatively impact performance, choose this setting only when your compliance policies require you to audit SQL statements.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Capture transaction status for DML&#160;activity</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to specify whether you want to collect the status of all DML&#160;transactions that are executed by T-SQL scripts run on your audited database. This setting captures begin, commit, rollback, and savepoint statuses. To capture these statuses, you must enable DML auditing.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Ensure the Collection Server and the target SQL Server computers have ample resources to handle the additional data collection, storage, and processing. Because this setting can significantly increase resource requirements and negatively impact performance, choose this setting only when your compliance policies require you to audit transaction status, such as rollbacks.</p>
