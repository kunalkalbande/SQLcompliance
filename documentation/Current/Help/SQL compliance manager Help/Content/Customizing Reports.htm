        <p class="Body">You can customize any of the integrated audit reports or develop new reports that fit your unique auditing needs. First, deploy the SQL Compliance Manager Reports to your existing Microsoft Reporting Services. Then select which reports you want to customize from the corresponding RDL files (by default, these files are stored in the Anytime folder under the SQL CM Reports root folder on the Report Server). <span class="If_Then_Statement">If you decide to customize these reports</span>, consider the following best practices:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li class="Bullet">Save your new and modified reports to a separate folder</li>
            <li class="BulletLast">Use a different filename for modified reports</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">For more information about deploying SQL&#160;CM Reports, see <a href="Generating Reports MSRS.htm">Generating Reports with Microsoft Reporting Services</a>. For more information about developing custom reports, see the Reporting Services Books Online.</p>
