        <h1 class="Heading1">Implement a disaster recovery strategy</h1>
        <p class="Body">
            <MadCap:keyword term="auditing:disaster recovery;disaster recovery" />A disaster recovery strategy allows you to plan for unexpected outages to ensure you can continue auditing SQL Server activity and policy compliance.        </p>
        <p class="Body">When you implement SQL Compliance Manager in your production SQL Server environment, consider preparing a disaster recovery strategy to minimize audit data loss should the Collection Server become unavailable. Use the following procedures and guidelines to implement a new disaster recovery strategy or modify an existing disaster recovery strategy.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Identify how often to back up the Repository databases</h2>
        <p class="Body">The frequency at which you back up the <a href="Architecture and Components.htm">Repository databases</a> depends on the following factors:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li class="Bullet">How often your audit settings change</li>
            <li class="Bullet">How often your SQL Server environment changes as you add new servers and databases or remove older servers and databases</li>
            <li class="Bullet">How much audit data you collect in a given time period</li>
            <li class="BulletLast">How much risk you are willing to incur</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">The backup frequency should reflect your maintenance needs and allow you to meet future compliance requirements.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Schedule routine backups of the Repository databases</h2>
        <p class="Body">After you identify the appropriate backup frequency for your compliance needs, use a tool such as Idera SQL Safe to schedule routine backups of the <a href="Architecture and Components.htm">Repository databases</a>.</p>
