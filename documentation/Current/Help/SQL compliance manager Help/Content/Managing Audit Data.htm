            </MadCap:keyword>You can optimize auditing performance and preserve your compliance history through SQL&#160;Compliance Manager archives. Archiving allows you to off-load collected and processed events from the Repository databases to an archive database. Your audit data remains available for reporting and viewing without impacting your collection and processing performance. To view or report on archived events, simply attach the archive database.</p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="If_Then_Statement">If your environment requires more aggressive data management</span>, consider implementing a maintenance plan for your archive databases to meet your storage and performance needs. Consider using tools such as Idera SQL Safe to quickly and securely back up archive databases so that you maintain optimal performance on the host SQL Server instance. Also consider grooming older event data. You can groom audited events from selected archive databases using the Management Console.</p>
