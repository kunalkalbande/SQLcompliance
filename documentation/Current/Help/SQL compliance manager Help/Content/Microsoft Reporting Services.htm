        <p class="Body">In addition to allowing you to generate reports from within the Management Console, you can also integrate these reports into Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (Reporting Services). </p>
        <p class="Body">Deploying SQL compliance manager Reports to your existing Reporting Services installation allows you to create subscriptions that run selected reports on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. Each daily, weekly, or monthly report is preset to this time period and is linked to the original RDL file for that report.</p>
        <p class="Body">Through Reporting Services, you can also customize specific reports to meet your unique auditing needs. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="Customizing Reports.htm" mc-format="{para}" target="" title="" alt="">Customizing Reports</MadCap:xref>.
