        <h2 class="Heading2">4.3 new features</h2>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">SQL CM 4.3 now offers a Collection Server only install</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">SQL Compliance Manager 4.3 now allows you to install the Collection Server and Repository only to support installing SQL CM on a cluster.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">4.3 fixed issues</h2>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">There are no fixed issues in this release.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">4.2 new features</h2>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">New Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) guideline</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Apply the new FERPA regulatory guideline to ensure your audited databases meet the requirements of this legislation. You can apply this guideline through the <a href="http://www.idera.com/Help/SQLcm/4-3/Web/Default_CSH.htm#/Enabling Auditing on a Database.htm|WebHelpSkinSilver" target="_blank">CLI</a> or through the <a href="http://www.idera.com/Help/SQLcm/4-3/Web/Default_CSH.htm#/Importing Your Audit Settings.htm|WebHelpSkinSilver" target="_blank">Import Audit Settings feature</a> in the Console.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">FERPA was introduced in 1974. This federal law mandates the confidentiality and protection of student information in any educational institution that receives funding from the Federal Government from kindergarten through the university level. FERPA generally prevents an education agency or institution from sharing student records or personally identifiable information in those records with individuals who are not authorized to view that information. In some cases authorized individuals need to be monitored to deter insider theft and unauthorized dissemination of information.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">New Sarbanes Oxley (SOX) guideline</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Apply the new SOX regulatory guideline to immediately enforce the right auditing settings for sensitive financial data. Collect a detailed audit trail of all access to that data and then deliver reports  that prove your compliance to auditors. You can apply this guideline through the <a href="http://www.idera.com/Help/SQLcm/4-3/Web/Default_CSH.htm#/Enabling Auditing on a Database.htm|WebHelpSkinSilver" target="_blank">CLI</a> or through the <a href="http://www.idera.com/Help/SQLcm/4-3/Web/Default_CSH.htm#/Importing Your Audit Settings.htm|WebHelpSkinSilver" target="_blank">Import Audit Settings feature</a> in the Console.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">SOX,  also known as the Corporate and Auditing Accountability and Responsibility Act, was first introduced in 2002. This legislation was put in place as a response to the corporate and accounting scandals which cost investors billions of dollars. From an information technology standpoint, security professionals and database administrators must collectively implement policies and processes that audit permissions on, and access to, financial data as well data changes such as before and after values.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">New CLI actions register instances and apply audit settings</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Use the new command line interface (CLI)&#160;actions to quickly and easily <a href="http://www.idera.com/Help/SQLcm/4-3/Web/Default_CSH.htm#/Registering Your SQL Servers.htm|WebHelpSkinSilver" target="_blank">register large numbers of SQL Server instances</a> and immediately <a href="http://www.idera.com/Help/SQLcm/4-3/Web/Default_CSH.htm#/Enabling Auditing on a Database.htm|WebHelpSkinSilver" target="_blank">apply audit settings to the hosted databases</a>. You can choose to apply the default audit settings, custom audit settings you have exported from another audited instance, or a regulation guideline.</p>

        <h2 class="Heading2">3.7 new features</h2>

        <p class="DefinitionListBody">SQL Compliance Manager 3.7 is SQL Server 2012 RTM compatible.

        <h2 class="Heading2">3.7 fixed issues</h2>

        <h2 class="Heading2">3.3 fixed issues</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li class="Bullet">SQL Compliance Manager now supports auditing SQL&#160;Server instances located in environments that require <a href="http://www.idera.com/Help/SQLcm/4-3/Web/Default_CSH.htm#/FIPS Compliance.htm|WebHelpSkinSilver" target="_blank">FIPS compliance</a>.</li>
            <li class="Bullet">The Collection Server now no longer performs duplicate processing of events collected in high-traffic environments. When this issue occurred, SQL&#160;Compliance Manager would write error and warning messages to the application event log, stating that it was either unable to read a trace file due to insufficient privileges or unable to delete the trace file due to a SQL&#160;Server lock.</li>
            <li class="Bullet">You can now <a href="http://www.idera.com/Help/SQLcm/4-3/Web/Default_CSH.htm#/Windows/Add Agent Service CLR Directory.htm|WebHelpSkinSilver" target="_blank">successfully audit before-after data</a> for DML events that occur on SQL Server databases hosted by a Windows Server Cluster.                   </li>
            <li class="BulletLast">The <a href="http://www.idera.com/Help/SQLcm/4-3/Web/Default_CSH.htm#/Windows/Database Properties BAD.htm|WebHelpSkinSilver" target="_blank">DML/SELECT Filters tab</a> of the Audited Database Properties window now allows you to successfully enable before-after auditing for DML&#160;events on specific database tables.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="Heading2">3.2 Hotfix 1 fixed issues</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li class="Bullet">The SQLcompliance Agent now correctly handles a fail over that occurs on an active-active Windows cluster.</li>
            <li class="BulletLast">When storing DML events collected for Before-After auditing, event processing now correctly stores each event only one time for statements that insert more than 1000 rows.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="Heading2">3.2 fixed issues</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li class="Bullet">The SQLcompliance Agent now refreshes its list of DBID (database identifier) properties at each heartbeat. This fix ensures that SQL Compliance Manager can continue collecting audit data for a database after its ID number changes. For example, database ID numbers can change when a database is dropped, backed up, re-attached, or restored.</li>
            <li class="Bullet">The groom job now correctly deletes all events older than the specified age.</li>
            <li class="Bullet">The groom job now correctly identifies the SQL Server version, ensuring it grooms before and after data generated by DML events in SQL Server 2005 or later only. The ability to collect before and after data is not supported on SQL Server 2000 instances.&#160;</li>
            <li class="BulletLast">Event Filters now support blank, empty, or null values when specifying application and host names.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="Heading2">3.1 Hotfix 1 fixed issues</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li class="Bullet">When attempting to audit DML activity on specific databases, the SQLcompliance Agent would sometimes fail to collect the DML events according to your audit settings. With this hotfix, the SQLcompliance Agent correctly audits the specified databases for DML activity.</li>
            <li class="Bullet">After enabling the ability to audit Before-After data on database tables, SQL Compliance Manager would require accounts to have administrator privileges to the tables created by SQL CM in order to modify data in the audited table, potentially preventing third-party applications and other accounts from writing to these tables. This hotfix allows SQL Server logins to read and write to the audited tables per the assigned privileges.</li>
            <li class="Bullet">When attempting to groom audit data from a SQL Compliance Manager Repository hosted on a SQL Server 2000 instance, the grooming process would fail, returning the error “incorrect syntax near the keyword 'TOP'”. With this hotfix, you can successfully groom the Repository.</li>
            <li class="Bullet">When you attempt to update the archive database indexes using the command-line interface or the Management Console, the update process would fail. With this hotfix, you can successfully update all archive databases to the new Repository schema.</li>
            <li class="Bullet">The Management Console did not correctly format statistics with large values, resulting in an incorrect Processed Events statistic on the Explore Activity views. This hotfix resolves these formatting issues.</li>
